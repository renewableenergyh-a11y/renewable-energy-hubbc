# Solar Energy Fundamentals - Test Module

## Introduction to Solar Energy
Solar energy is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. It is an essential source of renewable energy, and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture, convert and distribute solar energy.

## Key Concepts

### Solar Radiation
The energy produced by the sun is converted to solar energy. The amount of solar energy received at the Earth's surface is about 1000 watts per square meter on a clear day at solar noon.

### Photovoltaic Cells
Photovoltaic cells are devices that convert light directly into electricity. They are made of semiconductor materials such as silicon and rely on the photovoltaic effect to function.

## Types of Solar Technologies

### Solar Photovoltaic (PV)
- Converts sunlight directly into electricity
- Uses semiconductor materials
- No moving parts
- Minimal maintenance required

### Solar Thermal
- Converts sunlight into heat
- Used for water heating and space heating
- More efficient for heating applications
- Lower cost per unit of heat energy

## Advantages of Solar Energy
- Renewable and sustainable
- Zero operational emissions
- Low maintenance costs
- Decreasing installation costs
- Can be deployed at various scales
